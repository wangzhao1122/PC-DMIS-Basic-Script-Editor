The PC-DMIS Basic Script Editor is a built-in tool for creating, editing and running custom Basic scripts to automate part measurement tasks efficiently. It uses Cypress Enable, a user-friendly Basic subset for those with basic programming skills. To open it, select "View | Basic Script Editor" in PC-DMIS; it replaces the main menu with core menus (File, Edit, View, Run, Help), restorable by minimizing or closing it.
